# Trees

Trees consist of vertices ( nodes ) and edges that connext them. Trees are hierarchical. They are similar to Graphs, except that a cycle cannot exist in a Tree - they are acyclic. In other words there is always one path between any two nodes.

- **Root Node**: A node with no parent nodes. Generally, trees don't have to have a root. However, Rooted trees have one distinguished node.

- **Child Node**: A node linked to an upper node ( Parent Node)
- **Parent Nodes**: A node that has links to one or more Child Node
- **Sibling Node**: Nodes that share the same Parent Node
- **Leaf Node**: A node that doesn't have any children
- **Ancestor Nodes**: The nodes on the path fro a node d to the root node. Ancestor nodes include node d's parents, grandparents, and so on.

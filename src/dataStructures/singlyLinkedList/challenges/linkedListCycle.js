// We will use Floydâ€™s cycle-finding algorithm to detect a cycle in the linked list. In this algorithm, we use two pointers to check if a cycle exists in a linked list: a slow pointer that moves one node at a time and a fast pointer that moves two nodes at a time. If there is no cycle in the linked list, the fast pointer will reach the end of the linked list before the slow pointer. If there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually catch up to the slow pointer because it moves faster.

// Initialize two pointers, p1 and p2, to point to the head of the linked list.

// Traverse the linked list until the end of the linked list is reached.

// While traversing the linked list, move p1 one node at a time and move p2 two nodes at a time.

// If at any point the two pointers meet, it means that a cycle has been found. In this case, we return TRUE.

// If the end of the linked list is reached, that is, p2 is pointing to NULL, a cycle does not exist. In this case, we return FALSE.

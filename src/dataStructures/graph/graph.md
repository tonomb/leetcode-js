# Graph

A **graph** is a ser of nodes that are connnected to each other in the form of a network. FIrst of all, we'll define the two basic components of a graph.

## Vertex

A **vertex** is a esential part of a graph. A collection of vertices formas a graph.

## Edge

A **edge** is a link between two vertices. It can be uni-directional or bi-directional, depending on your graph. An edge can also have a cost associated with it.

## Graph Terminology

### Degree of a vertex:

The total number of edges connected to a vertex. There can be two types of degrees:

1. **In-Degree** The toal number of incoming edges connected to a vertex
2. **Out-Degree** The total number of outgoing edges connected to a vertex

### Paralled Edges

Two unidirected edges are parallel if they have the same end vertices.
Two directed edges are parallel if they have the same origin and destination

### Self Loop

This occurs when an edge starts and ends on the same vertex.

### Adjacency

Two vertices are said to be adjacent if there is an edge connecting them directly
